# Embedded Systems - EENG383
Embedded Systems Course repository.

## Description
The EENG383 repository documents my code for the various projects in the course. The course covers embbeded systems concepts such as timers, interupts, EUART, I2C, SPI, sampling, look up tables, and direct digital synthsis. The projects are written in C for the PIC18F25k22 on a custom development board. Development was done with the MPLABS IDE with MCC.

## Projects
**Lab01** - settup  
The project consisted of settup for the course. It incorporated testing all the subsystems on the development board.

**Lab02** - morse code  
The project consisted of blinking morse code messages on an LED.

**Lab03** - monophonic song  
The project involved of pulsing a speaker at various frequencies to play a song with the western notation system.  

**Lab04** - monophonic song game  
The project consited of playing a song on a speaker, and checking button pulses to see if a user was able to accuratly reproduce the song.

**Lab05** - RGB Color Tour  
The project involved fading an RGB LED through various colors.

**Lab06** - IR Reciver  
**Lab07** - IR Transmitter  
**Lab08** - sample microphone  
**Lab09** - store data  
**Lab10** - digital recoder  
**Lab11** - direct digital systhysis  
**Lab12** - sonic distance  
**Lab13 & Lab14** - assemble daughter board  
**Lab15** - final project
