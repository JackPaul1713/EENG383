# SEED Lab - EENG383
This repository is a fork of group 2's SEED Lab repository.

## Description
The EENG383 reposotory tracks group 2's progress as we develop an automated search and rescue robot. We are split into two teams computer vision, and localization and control. The robot is meant to navigate a feild of QR codes as quickly as possible. The computer vision is written in python on a Rasberry Pi. The localization and control is written in C++ on an Arduino. The robot incorporates feedback control systems for position and velocity control.
